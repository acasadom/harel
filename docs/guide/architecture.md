# Architecture — how harel works

This is the contributor-level deep dive: the layering, what is pure vs. stateful, and a
step-by-step walk through the real lifecycle of an execution — how it's created, where and
when it's persisted, how an event is loaded, processed into **effects**, those effects run,
and how an in-memory or distributed worker actually executes your functions.

If you only want to *author and run* machines, the [tutorial](../tutorial/01-getting-started)
and the [CLI](cli) / [durability](durability) guides are enough. This page is for changing the
engine.

The *formalism* — hierarchy, orthogonal (concurrent) regions, broadcast communication — is
**David Harel's**, from his 1987 paper *Statecharts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems*
([PDF](https://dubroy.com/refs/Statecharts_a_visual_formalism_for_complex_systems.pdf); he later
recounted how it came to be in [*Statecharts in the Making*](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/harel/sites/math.harel/files/users/user50/Statecharts.History.pdf), 2007).
This engine is named in his honour and makes that formalism durable and distributed; what
follows is how it does so.

## The shape of the design

harel splits a running statechart into three layers with a hard rule between them: **the
engine is a pure function of data, and never does IO**. Everything that touches the world —
calling your action functions, reading and writing the store, publishing to a queue — lives in
a *runner* outside the engine.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
  subgraph pure["PURE — no IO, fully deterministic"]
    direction LR
    Defn["Definition<br/><i>immutable program</i><br/>node tree, refs"]
    Engine["Engine (core.py)<br/><i>generators that describe effects</i><br/>start / process / set_state"]
  end
  subgraph stateful["STATEFUL — does the IO"]
    direction LR
    Runner["Runner (Driver)<br/><i>consumes effects, runs actions</i>"]
    Store["ExecutionStore<br/><i>durable checkpoint</i>"]
    Transport["Transport + Worker<br/><i>distributed delivery</i>"]
  end
  Exe["Execution<br/><i>serializable state</i>"]

  Engine -- "reads" --> Defn
  Engine -- "mutates" --> Exe
  Runner -- "drives" --> Engine
  Runner -- "runs your action fns" --> User["user (stm, event, **inputs) fns"]
  Runner -- "commit / load" --> Store
  Transport -- "claim / ack" --> Store
  Transport --> Runner
```

Why this split: keeping the engine a pure function of data — no IO, no user code — is what buys
the three properties harel is after.

- **Determinism & testability** — a run is just `Definition + Execution → effects`, reproducible
  and unit-testable without a store, a worker, or your action code.
- **Crash-safety** — because the engine only *describes* effects, the runner can apply them and
  advance the state in **one atomic checkpoint**, so a crash never leaves a half-applied step.
- **Portability** — the state logic navigates by **node references** and touches no backend, so
  the same engine runs in-memory or over sqlite / redis / postgres / … without changing a line.

The IO — your action functions, the store, the queue — lives entirely in the runner.

### 1. Definition — the immutable program (`harel/definition/`)

A `Definition` ([model.py](https://github.com/acasadom/harel/blob/main/src/harel/definition/model.py)) is the compiled machine: a tree
of `Node`s with **real `parent`/`children` references** and an `index: dict[full_path, Node]`.
`full_path` is only a *stable address* (for serialization), **not** the runtime navigation
mechanism — the engine walks references (`chain`, `lca`, `ancestors`). It's built once from the
DSL and never mutated. Actions/guards are referenced (`ActionRef.function` is a dotted string
**or** a callable); the Definition holds no execution state.

### 2. Execution — the serializable state (`engine/execution.py`)

An `Execution` is the running instance: `status`, `active_path` (the active leaf's `full_path`),
`history` (composite → last active child), `context` (your data), `outcome`, `version` (the
optimistic-concurrency token), `children` (the orthogonal join counter), `parent_id`/`child_id`.
It is **pure data** — round-trips to/from JSON, holds no references into the Definition. The
engine reads a Definition + an Execution and mutates the Execution in place.

### 3. Engine — pure, effects-based (`engine/core.py`)

`start`, `process`, `set_state` are **generators**. They mutate the Execution and `yield`
*descriptions of effects* — they never call your code or touch a store. The type is:

```python
# docs-test: skip
Step = Generator[Effect, Optional[ActionResult], None]   # core.py
```

## The effect protocol — how pure meets stateful

The engine yields an effect and the runner sends a result back. Effects come in two kinds:

| Effect | Kind | Runner does | Resume |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RunAction(node, hook, action, event)` | **blocking** | call `action(stm, event, **inputs)` | `gen.send(ActionResult(value=ret))` |
| `RunSelector(node, selector, event)` | **blocking** | call the selector fn, map result → target | `gen.send(ActionResult(value=ret))` |
| `Emit(event, to)` | deferred | enqueue the event (outbox) | `gen.send(None)` |
| `SpawnChildren(specs)` | deferred | queue child-Execution creations | `gen.send(None)` |
| `ScheduleTimer(path, delay, context_key)` | deferred | arm a durable timer | `gen.send(None)` |
| `CancelTimer(path)` | deferred | disarm the timer | `gen.send(None)` |

**Blocking** effects pause the generator until the runner sends back an `ActionResult` (this is
how a slow action or a remote FaaS call blocks the worker). **Deferred** effects are
fire-and-forget: the runner records them and continues immediately; they are persisted and acted
on *after* the commit (see the relay below).

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
  participant R as Runner (Driver._drive)
  participant E as Engine (process generator)
  R->>E: next(gen)
  E-->>R: RunAction(on_exit)
  R->>R: ret = on_exit(stm, event)
  R->>E: gen.send(ActionResult(ret))
  E-->>R: RunAction(on_enter)
  R->>R: ret = on_enter(stm, event)
  R->>E: gen.send(ActionResult(ret))
  E-->>R: ScheduleTimer(path, delay)
  R->>R: collect timer op
  R->>E: gen.send(None)
  E-->>R: Emit(Finished, to=parent)
  R->>R: collect emit
  R->>E: gen.send(None)
  E--xR: StopIteration (quiescent)
```

Your action functions run **only here**, inside `Driver._drive` ([runtime.py](https://github.com/acasadom/harel/blob/main/src/harel/engine/runtime.py)) — never inside `core.py`. The proxy passed as `stm`
exposes `execution_ctx` (the Execution's `context`) and a stable `idempotency_key`
(`{id}:{version}:{action_index}`) so a side effect can be made effect-once across an
at-least-once redelivery (see [durability](durability)).

### What `process` does inside (the pure part)

For one event, `process` ([core.py](https://github.com/acasadom/harel/blob/main/src/harel/engine/core.py)) resolves a transition by
**scope** (innermost composite wins; outer scopes are a fallback for *event* transitions only —
automatic lookups don't bubble), evaluating the `EventFilter` (kind with `A|B` alternation +
flat `field__op` predicates AND-ed with a composable `all`/`any`/`not` tree). Then `_take`
applies UML hook semantics over the LCA chain: **exit innermost-first, enter outermost-first,
each level runs its own `on_exit`/`on_enter`** (no override by depth), a self/local transition
fires nothing. `_drain` then runs automatic transitions to quiescence; a leaf with no outgoing
transition is a **sink** that bubbles to its composite, and a global sink sets `status=DONE` and
(if this Execution is an orthogonal region) emits `Finished` to its parent.

## The runner and the single atomic checkpoint

`Driver._run` is the checkpoint boundary. It drives the generator to quiescence, collecting the
deferred effects, then writes **everything in one transaction**:

```python
# docs-test: skip
def _run(self, exe, gen, event_id=None):
    emits, timer_ops, spawns = self._drive(exe, gen)     # run actions, collect deferred effects
    self.store.commit(exe, emits, processed_event_id=event_id,
                      timers=tuple(timer_ops), spawns=tuple(spawns))   # ONE atomic commit
```

`store.commit` ([store/_base.py](https://github.com/acasadom/harel/blob/main/src/harel/engine/store/_base.py)) persists, in a single transaction:

1. **the Execution** — a CAS write: `UPDATE … SET version=old+1 WHERE id=? AND version=old`
   (or an `INSERT` if brand-new). If the row moved on, it raises `StoreConflict` — the
   single-writer-per-Execution backstop.
2. **the outbox** — the emitted events (`Emit`), to be delivered after commit.
3. **the dedupe record** — `processed_event_id`, so an at-least-once redelivery is a no-op.
4. **the timers** — schedule/cancel, so a scheduled timer can never be lost (no dual-write).
5. **the spawns** — the orthogonal child-creation intents.
6. **the trace step** *(opt-in)* — one timeline entry when tracing is on (`STM_TRACE`), so the
   monitor timeline is recorded in the same atomic write; off by default (see [stores](stores)).

Either all of it commits or none does. This is the property that makes a crash safe: the state
advance, the `Finished` it must emit, the timer it armed, and the children it must spawn are one
unit.

After the commit, the **relay** (`_flush`) delivers the deferred work from the durable store —
creating each pending child (idempotently: skip if it already exists) and delivering each outbox
event — looping until quiescent. Because it reads the durable store, a crash-and-restart re-runs
it idempotently.

## Walkthrough — creating and running a machine (in-memory)

`DurableRunner` ([durable.py](https://github.com/acasadom/harel/blob/main/src/harel/engine/durable.py)) is the headless host over a
store (a synchronous façade over the async core — see *Async core, sync façade* below).
**Create** starts the engine and checkpoints; **process** loads, runs the
engine, checkpoints, and flushes.

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  actor C as Caller
  participant DR as DurableRunner
  participant D as Driver
  participant E as Engine (core)
  participant S as Store

  C->>DR: create(definition_id, context)
  DR->>D: start(exe)
  D->>E: start(defn, exe)  (generator)
  E-->>D: RunAction(on_enter) … (effects)
  D->>D: run action fns
  D->>S: commit(exe v1, emits, timers, spawns)
  D->>D: _flush() — create initial regions, deliver outbox
  DR->>S: load(exe.id)
  DR-->>C: Execution (committed)

  C->>DR: process(exe.id, event)
  DR->>S: load(exe.id)            %% rehydrate from the store
  DR->>D: inject(exe, event)
  D->>E: process(defn, exe, event)  (generator)
  loop until quiescent
    E-->>D: RunAction / RunSelector (blocking)
    D->>D: run your fn, gen.send(ActionResult)
    E-->>D: Emit / ScheduleTimer / SpawnChildren (deferred)
    D->>D: collect
  end
  D->>S: commit(exe v+1, emits, processed=event.id, timers, spawns)
  D->>D: _flush() — deliver outbox / create children
  DR->>S: load(exe.id)
  DR-->>C: Execution (committed)
```

The key points: **state is rehydrated from the store on every event** (the runner is stateless —
a fresh `Driver` per call, a pure function of Definition + store), and **persisted exactly once
per event boundary**, in the atomic `commit`. Your functions run during `_drive`; an unhandled
exception in one is caught by the production driver and fails the Execution terminally
(`status=FAILED`, the dead-letter) rather than crashing the worker.

## Orthogonal fork — crash-safe spawn via the outbox

Entering an AND-state doesn't create the regions inline. The engine yields `SpawnChildren`; the
runner records the intents, and they commit **atomically with the parent's advance and its join
expectations** (`children`). The relay then creates each child idempotently. So a crash mid-fork
neither double-spawns nor loses a region that finished on start.

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant E as Engine
  participant D as Driver
  participant S as Store
  E-->>D: SpawnChildren([region A, region B])
  D->>S: commit(parent, spawns=[A,B], children={A,B})   %% atomic: advance + join + spawns
  Note over D,S: parent is parked on the AND-state, waiting for the join
  D->>D: _flush()
  loop each pending spawn
    D->>S: load(child_id)  (skip if exists — idempotent)
    D->>E: start(defn, child)   %% region runs the same Definition, different root_path
    D->>S: commit(child v1)
    D->>S: ack_spawn(seq)
  end
  Note over E: each region, on its global sink, Emits Finished → parent_id
  D->>S: (later) deliver Finished → process(parent) → join when all children finished
```

Regions share the parent's event stream (a domain event is broadcast to all live regions — UML
semantics). Data-parallel work (N independent workers) is **not** an orthogonal state but a
fan-out `invoke`, which reuses the same child-Execution machinery.

## Durable timers

A state with `timeout: T` yields `ScheduleTimer` on enter and `CancelTimer` on exit; those ride
the **same commit** as the transition, so a scheduled timer can't be lost. When due, a sweep
delivers a `Timeout` event (with a stable id, so a double sweep dedupes) carrying the timed
state's `path`. `process` only fires the model's `on Timeout` transition **if that path is still
active** (a staleness guard), bubbling from the timed-out node up through its ancestors. Timers
are statechart-native: the engine schedules, the **model decides** what the timeout does — which
is why retry/backoff is modelled as a composite, not an engine feature.

## In-memory vs. distributed

The same engine and the same `commit` run in two hosts:

- **In-memory** (`Driver` / `DurableRunner`): the relay delivers emitted events *inline* (it
  calls `process` on the target itself). One process. Used for embedding and tests.
- **Distributed** (`TransportDriver` + `Worker` + `Transport`, [distributed.py](https://github.com/acasadom/harel/blob/main/src/harel/engine/distributed.py)): the relay **publishes** emitted events to a
  `Transport` (a queue) instead of delivering inline; workers claim and process them. Same code,
  many processes.

### Async core, sync façade

The engine in `core.py` is a **synchronous generator that does no IO** — it only `yield`s
effects. That is exactly what lets the *shell* be either synchronous or asynchronous without
touching the engine: the runner that interprets the effect stream decides whether to `await` the
action or call it inline. harel's runtime is **async-first** — the real implementation lives in
`harel/engine/aio/` (`AsyncDriver` / `AsyncDurableRunner` / `AsyncWorker`), and `python -m
harel.worker` runs one `asyncio` loop driving up to `STM_CONCURRENCY` events in flight. The
public **synchronous** API (`Driver`, `DurableRunner`, `DistributedRunner`, `Worker`) is a thin
**façade** that bridges to the async core through an [anyio](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/)
blocking portal (one background event loop), the way Starlette/FastAPI expose sync over async.
So the deterministic, synchronous snippets in this guide and the async production worker are the
same engine and the same commit, just two interpreters of the effect stream.

A `Transport` is a queue with **single-active-consumer per group**, where `group_id =
execution_id` — so at most one message per Execution is in flight, which is what upholds the
single-writer invariant (the store CAS is the backstop if a lease expires). A `Worker` loops
**claim → load → dedupe → route → ack**:

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant W as Worker.step()
  participant T as Transport
  participant S as Store
  participant TD as TransportDriver
  participant E as Engine

  W->>T: claim(worker_id, visibility)
  T-->>W: Lease(group_id=exe.id, event)
  W->>S: load(group_id)
  alt unknown or already processed
    W->>T: ack (no-op)
  else SUSPENDED
    W->>T: nack(delay)   %% park the group, don't spin
  else CANCELLED / (CANCELLING & not Cancel)
    W->>T: ack   %% drain the backlog as no-ops
  else live
    W->>TD: route(exe, event)
    alt domain event & live regions
      TD->>T: publish(event) to each region's group   %% fan out
      TD->>S: commit(exe, processed=event.id)
    else control event or no regions
      TD->>E: process(defn, exe, event)
      E-->>TD: effects (run actions, collect)
      TD->>S: commit(exe v+1, emits, processed, timers, spawns)
    end
    TD->>TD: _flush() → publish outbox to transport, create children
    alt StoreConflict (another writer won)
      W->>T: nack   %% redeliver, retry against fresh state
    else
      W->>T: ack
    end
  end
```

The worker honours the lifecycle status after load: `CANCELLED` → ack-drain; `SUSPENDED` →
`nack(delay)` (park so a paused group doesn't spin a worker); `CANCELLING` + non-`Cancel` →
ack-drain until the cooperative `Cancel` arrives. This is the **control plane**: lifecycle
commands ([control.py](https://github.com/acasadom/harel/blob/main/src/harel/engine/control.py)) CAS the Execution record directly, so
they land at the next event boundary instead of behind the FIFO backlog — portably, with no
transport priority/purge.

Timers in the distributed host: `Worker.fire_due_timers` runs on the idle path of the loop and
*publishes* the `Timeout` to the transport (vs. the synchronous host delivering it inline).

## Where state is persisted (checkpoint points)

| When | Call | What is written |
|---|---|---|
| create | `start()` → `commit` | Execution v1, initial region spawns, entry-hook timers |
| each event | `_run` → `commit` | Execution v+1 (CAS), outbox emits, dedupe id, timer ops, spawns, trace step (if `STM_TRACE`) |
| relay | `_create_spawn` → `commit` | each child Execution v1 (idempotent) |
| control plane | `control.*` → `commit` | status change (+ a cooperative `Cancel` emit), via CAS |
| timer fire | sweep → `process` → `commit` | the `Timeout` processed like any event; timer row deleted |

Two invariants hold everything together: **one atomic commit per event** (no dual-write window),
and **at-least-once delivery + per-event dedupe** (`processed_events` + `Event.id`), so a redelivery
takes effect exactly once. Side effects in *your* actions are made effect-once with the
`idempotency_key` against an external backend — harel records nothing extra there, because a
harel-side record would roll back with a failed commit.

## Recap

- The **engine is pure**: it reads a `Definition`, mutates an `Execution`, and yields **effects**.
  It never calls your code or does IO.
- The **runner** consumes those effects — running your action functions (blocking effects) and
  collecting the deferred ones — then writes one **atomic checkpoint** to the store.
- **Persistence is one transaction per event**: the state, the outbox, the dedupe, the timers and
  the spawns commit together; a relay delivers the deferred work afterwards from the durable store.
- **In-memory and distributed** are the same engine + the same commit, differing only in whether
  the relay delivers inline or publishes to a transport that workers claim — single-active-consumer
  per execution, with the store CAS as the backstop.
